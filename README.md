# BiN-TABL Data Normalization for Bilinear Structures in High Frequency Financial Time series
In this repository is presented the pytorch implementation of the paper [Data Normalization for Bilinear Structures in High Frequency Financial Time series](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9412547).

In particular I've implented BiN-B(TABL) and BiN-C(TABL).

I reached the same results of the original paper.

To run the code you just have to download the [FI-2010 dataset](https://etsin.fairdata.fi/dataset/73eb48d7-4dbc-4a10-a52a-da745b47a649/data) and to change the data path, then the notebook will do the rest, including the training and testing.
