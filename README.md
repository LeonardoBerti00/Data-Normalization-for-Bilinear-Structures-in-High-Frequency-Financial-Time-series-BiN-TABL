# BiN-TABL Data Normalization for Bilinear Structures in High Frequency Financial Time series
In this repository is proposed the pytorch implementation of the paper [Data Normalization for Bilinear Structures in High Frequency Financial Time series](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9412547) written by Dat Thanh Tran, Juho Kanniainen, Moncef Gabbouj and Alexandros Iosifidis. 

In the notebook is proposed all the machine learning pipeline, starting from the loading of the dataset, passing from the labeling method, creation of the datasets and dataloaders, ending with the train, validation and test.

I reached the same results of the original paper.

# Usage

To run the code you just have to download the [FI-2010 dataset](https://etsin.fairdata.fi/dataset/73eb48d7-4dbc-4a10-a52a-da745b47a649/data) and to change the data path, then the notebook will do the rest, including the training and testing.
