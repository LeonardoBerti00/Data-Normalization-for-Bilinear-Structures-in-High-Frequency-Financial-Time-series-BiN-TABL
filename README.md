# BiN-TABL Data Normalization for Bilinear Structures in High Frequency Financial Time series
In this repository is proposed the pytorch implementation of the paper [Data Normalization for Bilinear Structures in High Frequency Financial Time series](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9412547) written by Dat Thanh Tran, Juho Kanniainen, Moncef Gabbouj and Alexandros Iosifidis. 

The notebook presents a comprehensive machine learning pipeline that encompasses loading the dataset, applying labeling methods, creating datasets and dataloaders, and ultimately, executing the training, validation, and testing processes.

I reached the same results of the paper.

# Usage

To run the code you just have to download the [FI-2010 dataset](https://etsin.fairdata.fi/dataset/73eb48d7-4dbc-4a10-a52a-da745b47a649/data) and change the data path, then the notebook will do the rest, including the training and testing.
